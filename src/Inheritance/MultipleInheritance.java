public class MultipleInheritance {

    /*multiple inheritance is not paossible in java using classes ,,its only possible in terms of abstractina nd interface
    because one subclass cannot access 2 subclasses.. bcz it will raise a confusion from whom we need to inherit as we have 2 base cllass
it arises a diamond problem

example: a class gave to b and c
-> b and c(both) gave everything to d which is not possible
